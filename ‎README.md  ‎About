# Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction

This project applies data science techniques to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease using clinical data from over 70,000 patients. The analysis was conducted in R and includes a Shiny dashboard for interactive exploration.

# Project Overview

- Goal: Identify key predictors of cardiovascular disease and build interpretable models to support clinical decision-making.
- Techniques Used: 
  - Data Cleaning & Wrangling
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classification
  - Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity)
  - Shiny Dashboard for interactive predictions
 
 # Shiny Dashboard Features

- Tab 1: Exploratory Data Visuals (age, blood pressure, smoking)
- Tab 2: CVD Risk Prediction (user inputs generate real-time prediction)
